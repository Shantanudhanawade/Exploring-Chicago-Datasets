# Exploring-Chicago-Datasets
UNDERSTANDING OPEN (real world) DATA SETS of Chicago and connecting sql to jupyter .

To complete the project in this notebook we will be using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:

Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago:- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2   
Chicago Public Schools :- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t
Chicago Crime Data :- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I used SQLite3 as a library to connect SQL to Jupyter Notebooks for the following reasons:

Lightweight and Easy to Use: Minimal setup required, perfect for quick development.
File-Based Storage: Simplifies data management and sharing as a single file.
Seamless Integration: The sqlite3 library allows straightforward SQL commands execution within Jupyter.
No Configuration Needed: No complex setup, enabling a smooth development experience.
Ideal for Prototyping: Great for testing and developing applications before scaling.
